# Blackout Poetry Generator

This work was inspired by [this project](https://mkremins.github.io/blackout/) which black outs entire web pages. Specifically, I want to do two things to work on this

1. The first is to have it randomly generate a poem based on parameters passed by the user. Currently it's set at 50% because I literally did this in two hours and need a nap

2. The second is to use some kind of markov chain of probabilities to choose the next word. This will probably be done with some classification model on type of word. This part is not yet implemented because I am going to sleep but I'm writing down thoughts for future ivan to work on
